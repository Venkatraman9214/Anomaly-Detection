function [anomalyScores, anomalies] = isolationForest(data, numTrees, sampleSize)
% Function for performing anomaly detection using the Isolation Forest algorithm
% Inputs:
%   - data: Input data matrix (each row represents a data point, each column represents a feature)
%   - numTrees: Number of trees to build in the Isolation Forest
%   - sampleSize: Size of the random subsamples used for building each tree
% Outputs:
%   - anomalyScores: Anomaly scores for each data point (the higher the score, the more anomalous the point)
%   - anomalies: Binary vector indicating whether each data point is an anomaly (1) or not (0)

% Initialize variables
numDataPoints = size(data, 1);
anomalyScores = zeros(numDataPoints, 1);
anomalies = zeros(numDataPoints, 1);

% Build Isolation Forest

    % Randomly select a subsample of the data

    % Build the tree using the subsample
    treeModel = buildTree(subsample);

    pathLengths = getPathLengths(data, treeModel);
    
    % Update anomaly scores
    anomalyScores = anomalyScores + pathLengths;
end

% Normalize anomaly scores between 0 and 1
anomalyScores = anomalyScores / numTrees;

% Set threshold for classifying anomalies

% Classify anomalies

% Function for building a single tree in the Isolation Forest
% Insert your tree building code here

% Function for calculating path lengths for each data point in a tree
% Insert your path length calculation code here

% Example usage
data = randn(1000, 10); % Sample data matrix (replace with your own data)
numTrees = 100; % Number of trees to build in the Isolation Forest
sampleSize = 256; % Size of the random subsamples used for building each tree
